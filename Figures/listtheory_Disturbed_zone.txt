\begin{enumerate}
	\item The disturbed zone is larger on the inner edge than the outer edge.
	\item The disturbed zone narrows behind the nozzle.
	\item The disturbed zone widens at the nozzle.
	\item On successive passes, the inner side of the disturbed zone grows due to a more compliant inner boundary, while the outer disturbed zone shrinks due to a less compliant outer boundary.
	\item The Oldroyd number decreases on the inner edge by less than it increases on the outer edge.
	\item Increasing the TEGDMA concentration in the ink and increasing the print speed elongates and narrows the disturbed zone.
