\begin{enumerate}
	\item The transverse component of the contact line velocity is greater on glass than on support because the support is sloped.
	\item Adding another ink line pulls existing ink lines outwards (negative).
	\item The contact lines travel in opposite directions.
	\item Only the outer edge of the nearest neighbor is pulled outward.
	\item Ink wets ink more strongly than it wets support, so the existing lines on later passes pull the new line inward (positive) more strongly than the support did.
	\item Higher TEGDMA concentrations decrease the viscosity of the ink, decreasing its resistance to flow.
	\item Faster flow speeds increase the shear strain rate on the ink and decrease its viscosity, decreasing its resistance to flow.
	\item Faster translation speeds decrease the relaxation time, decreasing the change during relaxation.
	\item Because the support boundary conditions are symmetric, the only shift in the new line due to capillarity happens because existing ink pulls the new line inwards.
	\item Only the outer edge of the nearest neighbor is pulled outward., other stay
	\item On successive passes, more ink-ink contact lines are introduced, increasing the inward pull on the new line.
	\item On successive passes, more ink-ink contact lines are introduced, increasing the outward pull on the existing line.
