\begin{enumerate}
	\item There is no barrier to spreading on the outer edge.
	\item The center of gravity settles lower onto the substrate, widening the line.
	\item On pass 1 and 2, the deposited line shifts outward, but on the last pass, the line is bordered on both sides by support, so it does not shift due to gravity.
	\item On pass 1 and 2, the deposited line spreads, but on the last pass, the line is bordered on both sides by support, so it does not spread due to gravity.
	\item Increasing the TEGDMA content and increasing the print speed decreases the ink viscosity, decreasing its resistance to spreading.
	\item Increasing the translation speed decreases the relaxation time, decreasing changes due to relaxation.
\end{enumerate}
