bigtable2_fulledge.csv
Each row: average distribution positions and widths and transverse flow velocities over a single edge of a single pass of a single printed polygon. Filtered to include as much of the edge as possible without including the polygon corner.

bigtable2_middleedge.csv
Each row: average distribution positions and widths and transverse flow velocities over a single edge of a single pass of a single printed polygon. Filtered to only include the middle 2 mm of the edge, for 6-12 mm edges.

changetable_middleedge.csv
Each row: average changes in distribution between passes during relaxation and shear for a single edge of a polygon.

combinetable_middleedge.csv
bigtable2 and changetable combined. Each row: averages over all passes for each edge.
